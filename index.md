## What is a software or code license?

A software or code license is a document that provides legally binding guidelines for the use and distribution of software. These contracts include a series of terms and clauses that the user must comply with in order to use it. Also software licenses typically provide end users with the right to one or more copies of the software without violating copyrights and they specify protections if the software or its use infringes on the intellectual property rights of others too.

## Type of licenses
There are many types of licenses that anyone can use for their projects, but we can classify them into 5 basic types:

[**Public domain Licenses**](https://github.com/Bankaster/Software-Code-Licenses/blob/gh-pages/index.md#public-domain-licenses)

[**Lesser General Public Licenses**](https://github.com/Bankaster/Software-Code-Licenses/blob/gh-pages/index.md#lesser-general-public-licenses)

[**Permissive Licenses**](https://github.com/Bankaster/Software-Code-Licenses/blob/gh-pages/index.md#permissive-licenses)

[**Copyleft Licenses**](https://github.com/Bankaster/Software-Code-Licenses/blob/gh-pages/index.md#copyleft-licenses)

[**Proprietary Licenses**](https://github.com/Bankaster/Software-Code-Licenses/blob/gh-pages/index.md#proprietary-licenses)


### Public domain Licenses
This software is freely available. Anyone can use and change it or incorporate code from this software into an application. However, businesses should use caution as altered code may not meet enterprise quality and security standards. Companies should be wary of ambiguous licenses that appear to be public domain but do not explicitly say so.

### Lesser General Public Licenses
A Lesser General Public License (LGPL) is a license for open-source software that allows for provisions for including elements of free software in either free or proprietary software. Lesser General Public License is sometimes referred to as "Library GPL" or "GNU libraries," and some associate it with the idea of engineering for libraries in shared resources.

### Permissive Licenses
This type of license will establish some requirements for distribution or modification of the software. It also has requirements for preserving license notices, copyrights or trademarks. There are several variations of permissive licenses, including Apache, BSD (Berkeley Source Distribution) and MIT licenses.

### Copyleft Licenses
Licensed code may be distributed or modified as part of a software application or project if all code involved is distributed under the same license. New products containing old code with a copyleft license must comply with the restrictions laid out in the old code's license.

### Proprietary Licenses
This is the most restrictive license type. Proprietary software licenses make it illegal to copy, modify or distribute the software. These licenses provide the software owners with the most protection from unauthorized use of the software.

## Other types of licenses
Another example of licenses types will be Trial licenses that allows the user to use the software for a limited time, or the Demo licenses which offers the user a fraction of the complete software to test it.

## Open-source software licences
here are some links where you can check a [**list of open-source video games**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games) or a [**comparison of free and open-source software licences**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licences) in case you need to decide what type of license your projects need.
